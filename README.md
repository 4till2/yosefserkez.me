# Help Genie

> When the world needs our help we often wonder how. Help Genie is for discovering and sharing ways to help each other.

I put this project together in response to the Russia Ukraine (February 2022), while looking for a way to help those
impacted. The best way to contribute is by sharing new resources with me either through the form linked on site, or via
a pull request against the respective ["database"](./db).

As of now im generating a static site through a custom script each time a new resource is added. In the future I may
implement an actual database to extend the site towards other issues and features.
